Machine Learning Exercise – KNN & Random Forest

This is the second exercise of the course Introduction to machine learning 

Overview
This repository contains an educational exercise for the Introduction to Machine Learning course. The goal is to implement and compare two machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest.

These implementations are designed for learning purposes and are not optimized for production use. Additionally, the code contains comments to guide understanding, but it is not meant to be copied without comprehension.

Files Description
DecisionStump.py – Implements a simple decision stump, often used as a weak learner in boosting algorithms.

GreedyBoosting.py – Contains an implementation of a greedy boosting algorithm.

helpers.py – Includes utility functions used across different scripts.

knn.py – Implements the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

If you have any concerns or questions about this code, please do not contact the author. Instead, refer to the course materials or seek help from instructors.
